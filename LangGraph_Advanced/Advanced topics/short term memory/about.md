Implementing **short-term memory** in chatbots can be achieved through persistence,enabling them to remember previous conversations. This allows users to pick up where they left off, enhancing the chatbotâ€™s ability to allowing users to resume past conversations.

For a practical demonstration of this concept, refer to the last  chatbot where we use memory .
