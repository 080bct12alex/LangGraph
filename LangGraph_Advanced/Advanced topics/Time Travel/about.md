## Time Travel Feature

Persistence enables **time travel** in workflows, allowing users to replay the execution of processes from specific checkpoints for debugging and error analysis. By revisiting these past checkpoints, users can modify values and rerun the workflow, observing how changes affect the outcomes. This functionality is especially useful in complex workflows for resolving issues and improving system performance.
