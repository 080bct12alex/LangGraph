## Fault Tolerance

Persistence aids in **fault tolerance**, allowing workflows to resume from the exact point of failure without needing to restart from the beginning.  


In a practical demonstration, a three-step workflow with a controlled delay was interrupted to simulate a crash, after which the workflow resumed seamlessly from the paused state. The process illustrated how state values are preserved, ensuring that operations can continue as intended after an interruption.
