## Real-World Scenarios
Exploring how langsmith can play a crucial role in solving the issue.



### Job Application Tool

Exploring the challenges faced by students when job hunting , particularly the repetitive task of **modifying resumes** and **cover letters** for each application. This process can be tedious and time-consuming, often involving multiple job listings and constant updates to application materials. 

A startup team aims to address this problem with LangSmith by introducing an automated tool for students. 
The tool enables students to upload job descriptions or PDFs, which it then analyzes alongside the student's profile to create **tailored cover letters**.
By analyzing both the job requirements and the student's profile, the tool matches relevant skills and refines the cover letter to ensure it is effective and well-written. With an average processing time of **2 minutes**, students can use this tool multiple times daily to enhance their job application process, helping students streamline their job search.

### Debugging Latency Issues

Increased latency in a system has caused processing times to rise from 2 minutes to 10, frustrating users and resulting in  revenue loss for the startup.  Debugging this issue is complicated due to the **complexity of the LLM workflow**, which involves multiple stages and tasks as there's no detailed breakdown of each process.Identifying / pinpointing the specific source of the delay is challenging without proper tools to analyze the individual components involved in the workflow.
 
LangSmith can help track each step of the process, identifying inefficiencies and improving system performance.

### Research Assistant Tool

The **research assistant tool** assists researchers by fetching academic papers related to their chosen topic,  such as solar energy from sources like Google Scholar. 

It extracts key points from these papers and summarizes them into a report that users can inquire about. This tool operates similarly to Chat GPT and involves costs associated with generating reports using language models.



### Cost Analysis in LLMs
The increase in costs for generating reports using **OpenAI's API** has raised concerns about profitability, especially when certain reports shift from a cost of 50 paisa to ₹2. This change is attributed to an update that altered how the agent assesses report quality, leading to repeated processing for some reports to ensure perfection. Consequently, developers face challenges in debugging, as the system's behavior varies without clear error tracing, highlighting the need for enhanced observability to monitor costs throughout the workflow.

LangSmith can monitor the system’s **cost efficiency** by evaluating reports’ processing time, highlighting where inefficiencies or unnecessary reprocessing occur.



## Chatbot for HR Queries
A RAG-based **chatbot** designed to assist new employees with HR queries (e.g., leave policies, health insurance)
However, after its implementation, the chatbot began to provide incorrect information, leading to potential **misinformation** and serious concerns within the company, necessitating urgent debugging of the system.

#### Debugging Hallucinations
Debugging a RAG-based system can be challenging, especially when dealing with **hallucinations** caused by the retriever or generator components. Issues may arise from improper document fetching due to incorrect configurations, or the LLM's quality may be affected by upgrades . A systematic approach to monitor and analyze each component's performance is crucial for identifying the source of hallucinations.

 Debugging the cause of these errors is made easier with LangSmith's **observability features**, helping to identify and correct the source of the problem.
