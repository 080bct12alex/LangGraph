Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take a task or goal from a user and work towards completing  it independently  with minimal human guidance. It plans, takes action, adapts to changes  and seeks help only when necessary.

Unlike Generative AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), which are reactive and respond only to specific questions at a given moment,
Agentic AI is a new generation of AI systems capable of **proactive and autonomous**, **take initiative** , **autonomous decision-making**, **self-planning**, and **adaptive action**.

üîÅ **Example:** An AI agent  Agentic AI can plan a trip to Pokhara by researching travel options, accommodations, and  suggesting itineraries‚Äî**entirely autonomously**.
‚Äîhighlighting its initiative-taking nature.

 





## üíº Practical Scenario Example: HR Recruitment

In this scenario, the Agentic AI chatbot aids HR recruiters by:

- Drafting job descriptions  
- Posting them on platforms  
- Monitoring applications  
- Screening candidates  
- Adapting strategies based on responses  
- Scheduling interviews  
- Drafting offer letters  
- Managing onboarding  

This demonstrates the chatbot's **proactive, autonomous capabilities** in achieving hiring goals with minimal human intervention.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Agentic AI Characteristics

Agentic AI systems are defined by six key characteristics:

---

![Key-Characteristics-of-Agentic-AI-Systems](https://i.ibb.co/XZPHvRVs/Key-Characteristics-of-Agentic-AI-Systems.png)
---

| Characteristic        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Autonomy**          |  Makes decisions and acts without constant human guidance._Example: An AI recruiter proactively managing job applications._              |
| **Goal-Oriented**     |  Focuses actions on achieving defined objectives. Capable of altering goals as needed.                                         |
| **Planning**          | Generates and evaluates multiple plans based on efficiency, tools, cost, and risk. Breaks down high-level goals into subgoals.                             |
| **Reasoning**         | Interprets data, draws conclusions, selects tools, and makes decisions for execution.
| **Adaptability**      | Modifies strategies in real-time based on feedback or unexpected changes.               |
| **Context Awareness** | Tracks user preferences, task progress, and environment information   to stay on course using both short- and long-term memory.  |

## üß† Agentic AI Components

To determine if a chatbot is truly agentic, six questions must be answered affirmatively. Agentic AI systems include the following five essential components:

---

| Component      | Role                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brain**      | Powered by LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), interprets tasks, plans tasks, reasons, selects tools, and handles communication. |
| **Orchestrator** | Executes LLM-generated plans, Manages  conditional logic for task flow/sequencing. |
| **Tools**      | Enable interaction with with APIs, services, databases, email, and external world |
| **Memory**     | short-term and long-term memory to support personalized, consistent, and efficient task completion.   |
| **Supervisor** | Provides human oversight, including permissions, ethical guardrails, and approval flows for high-risk tasks.
