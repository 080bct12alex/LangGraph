Sequential Workflows and Parallel Workflows
    Sequential workflows involve executing tasks in a linear manner, one after the other. 
    In contrast, parallel workflows allow multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, as illustrated by a flowchart where tasks two and three run concurrently after task one is completed, leading to task four. This branching structure highlights the use of parallel processing within task execution.

Conditional Workflows
    Conditional work flow mimics parallel work flow but allows only one branch to be executed based on a condition, much like an if-else statement in programming. 

Parallel Workflows VS Conditional Workflows
    Conditional workflows involve branching paths similar to parallel workflows, but the key difference is that only one branch is activated based on specific conditions, rather than engaging all branches simultaneously.
