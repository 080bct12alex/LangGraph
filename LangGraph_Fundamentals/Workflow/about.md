# Fundamentals of Lang Graphs and Basic Agentive AI Functionalities

Lang graphs are used to represent tasks and decision flows in an AI system, enabling autonomous decision-making. Agentive AI systems can execute tasks, adapt, and make decisions without human intervention.

## Demonstrated how to create various Workflows
- **Sequential**: Tasks are performed one after another.
- **Parallel**: Tasks are executed simultaneously.
- **Conditional**: Tasks depend on conditions being true or false.
- **Looping**: Tasks repeat until a condition is met.

These workflows are essential for building agentic AI applications, enabling structured, efficient task execution and decision-making.
